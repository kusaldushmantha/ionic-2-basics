constructor(private modalCtrl: ModalController) {}
  onViewQuote(quote: Quote){
     const modal = this.modalCtrl.create(QuotePage);
     modal.present();
  }

QuotePage is the page that will be loaded as the overlay.

export class QuotePage {

  constructor(private viewCtrl: ViewController){}

  onClose(){
    this.viewCtrl.dismiss();
  }

}

On QuotePage, ViewController is used to manage modalPage. Since this is created not by page stack i.e. NavPush; this cannot popped by NavPop. Therefore viewCtrl.dismiss() is used;

ViewController can be used to manage the behaviour of any page / modal

* NavParams can be used to pass data to modal even if it is not built on PageStack.
