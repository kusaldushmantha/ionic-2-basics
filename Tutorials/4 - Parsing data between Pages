1. Add a click event lister to button that calls the next page
	(click)="onLoadUser('<arg to be passed>')"

2. Pass data as an object to the page that is to be loaded. In this case, UserPage will
recieve an object with {userName: name}; name= argument passed by click listener. 
  onLoadUser(name: string){
    this.navCtrl.push(UserPage, {userName: name});
  }

3. On UserPage use get property on navParams to retrieve data and assign it to a variable.
	constructor(private navParams: NavParams){
        	this.name = this.navParams.get('userName')
        }

   or equivalently use ngInit hook to do the above.
	export class UserPage implements OnInit{

	    constructor(private navParams: NavParams){}

	    name: string;

	    ngOnInit(){
		this.name = this.navParams.get('userName')
	    }

	}

4. Make sure to register newly created pages on app.module.ts
